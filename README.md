ðŸ”­ **What I'm Currently Working On:**  
After 11 years in B2B marketing for tech-centric industries like industrial printing and e-commerce, I've taken a bold step into software development. I'm currently immersed in the 42 school curriculum, honing my skills in C and shell scripting.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m Currently Learning:**  
My journey at 42 has been thrilling, with projects ranging from low-level programming to complex algorithms. I also competed in the regional AWS Deep Racer competition in Strasbourg, February 2024, where my algorithm secured 2nd place!

ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to Collaborate On:**  
I'm keen to collaborate on AI-driven open-source projects, especially those aimed at educational tools or improving lives. If you're working on something where my marketing and user experience insights can add value, let's connect!

I'm delving into AI and its applications in real-world problems, especially in educational or healthcare contexts. I'd greatly appreciate your insights and guidance! Additionally, I'm exploring mobile development and advanced Dart projects. If you have expertise in Flutter or Dart, your advice would be invaluable!

The best way to reach me is through [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandrakanna). I'm always open to discussing tech, career shifts, and potential collaborations.

âš¡ **Fun Fact:**
Languages have always fascinated me. From my native Spanish to English, Portuguese, and French, each language has enriched my work and travel experiences. Now, I'm translating this passion into programming languages. Each new programming language is like a new culture to explore, offering unique ways to communicate and solve problems. I'm thrilled by the endless possibilities in tech, mirroring the excitement I felt learning my first foreign language.
