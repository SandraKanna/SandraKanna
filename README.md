After 11 years in B2B marketing for tech industries, I’ve made the leap into full-time software development. I completed the 42 core curriculum, working on projects ranging from low-level C programming and algorithms to 3D rendering and full-stack web apps. Now diving deeper into Fastify, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern web stacks, I’m eager to contribute to real-world projects and keep bridging creativity and technology.

⚡ **Fun Fact:**  
Languages have always fascinated me. From my native Spanish to English, Portuguese, and French, each language has enriched my work and travel experiences. Now, I'm translating this passion into programming languages. Each new programming language is like a new culture to explore, offering unique ways to communicate and solve problems.
