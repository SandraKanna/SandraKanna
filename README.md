With 11 years of B2B marketing experience in tech-driven industries like industrial printing and e-commerce, I’ve embarked on a journey to bridge the gap between marketing and technology. I’ve completed C programming and shell scripting projects at 42 and am now diving into C++ and advanced topics like 3D rendering and full-stack development. While my focus is on mastering these technical skills, I’m eager to apply my combined expertise in a dynamic tech environment

⚡ **Fun Fact:**  
Languages have always fascinated me. From my native Spanish to English, Portuguese, and French, each language has enriched my work and travel experiences. Now, I'm translating this passion into programming languages. Each new programming language is like a new culture to explore, offering unique ways to communicate and solve problems. I'm thrilled by the endless possibilities in tech, mirroring the excitement I felt learning my first foreign language.
